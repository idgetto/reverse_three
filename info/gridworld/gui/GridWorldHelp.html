How to play:
<br>
<br> 	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game begins with each player having three pieces placed in the center of the board. Blue begins by placing a piece, blue-sideup, adjacent to a piece of another color and opposite another blue piece, so that a line of one or more othercolored pieces directly intervenes(horizontally, vertically or diagonally) between the two blue pieces. In other words, blue's pieces should sandwich one or morepieces of another color. Keep in mind, you may capture one or morepieces on a given turn. Also, you may capture any number of youropponent's pieces in one or more rows diagonally, vertically and horizontally. If you cannot make a legal move, you automatically pass your turn to one of your opponents. If no player is able to make a legal move, the game ends and the tiles will be tallied. The player at the end of the game with the most tiles of their color on the grid is the winner.
